Release pipelines enable teams to continuously deploy their application across different stages with lower risk and with faster pace. Deployments to each stage can be fully automated by using jobs and tasks.

Teams can also take advantage of the Approvals and Gates feature to control the workflow of the deployment pipeline. Each stage in a release pipeline can be configured with pre-deployment and post-deployment conditions that can include waiting for users to manually approve or reject deployments, and checking with other automated systems that specific conditions are met. In addition, teams can configure manual validations to pause the deployment pipeline and prompt users to carry out manual tasks then resume or reject the deployment.
