You can use the following information as a reference for the previous chapter

1. For the Dockerfile, put the following in a file with the name of Dockerfile. Remember to place this as part of your code or upload it to your Azure Repos - Git repository

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 AS build-env
WORKDIR /app
 
# Copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore
 
# Copy everything else and build
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out
 
# Build runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "docker-app.dll"]
2. You can use the below YAML for reference for the build pipeline. But use the task wizard to add the Docker task , because this will create the service connection to the Azure Container registry

# Docker
# Build and push an image to Azure Container Registry
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/docker

  containerRegistry: 'appregistry60001.azurecr.io'
  dockerfilePath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/dockerweb/Dockerfile'
