You can use the following as a reference for the previous chapter

1. Create a file named WebRole.ps1 and add the following contents

Configuration DScConfiguration {
	Node $AllNodes.Where{$_.Role -eq "WebServer"}.NodeName
    {
		WindowsFeature IISInstall {
			Ensure = 'Present'
			Name   = 'Web-Server'
   }
 
}}
You need to also zip this file.

2. Create a data configuration file as InstallWebconfig.psd1 and add the following contents

@{
  AllNodes = @(  
 
        @{
            NodeName        = "localhost"
            Role            = "WebServer"
        }
)
}
